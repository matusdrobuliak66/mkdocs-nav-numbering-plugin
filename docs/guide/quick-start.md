# Quick Start

A fast walkthrough.

## Install

Install the plugin and add it to your MkDocs configuration.

### Step 1: Add to plugins

Confirm that the plugin appears under the `plugins` section.

### Step 2: Configure numbering

Adjust `nav_depth`, `heading_depth`, and `separator` to match your docs structure.

## Verify output

Build the site and check that headings show the expected numbers and anchors.

### Check the URL hash

Click a heading and confirm that the URL hash updates correctly.

#### Sub-check: original anchors

If `add_original_anchors` is enabled, old hashes should still resolve.

## Next steps

Try adding more nested headings to see how numbering scales.
