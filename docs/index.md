# Welcome

This is a sample MkDocs site to showcase navigation numbering.

## Overview

Use this site to verify how numbering affects navigation titles and heading anchors.

### What to look for

- Numbered headings in the content area
- Updated anchors in the URL hash
- Optional original anchors for backward compatibility

## Why numbering helps

Numbering makes large manuals easier to scan and cross-reference. It also keeps a
stable hierarchy when the content grows over time.

### Common use cases

- Engineering manuals
- Process documentation
- Internal knowledge bases

## Example structure

This page has multiple heading levels so you can test anchor changes and numbering depth.

### Subsection A

Short paragraph to generate a slug and anchor.

#### Subsection A.1

Nested content for deeper anchor testing.

### Subsection A

Another sibling subsection to test numbering increments.
